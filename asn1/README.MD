This is the ASN.1 specification for KXOVER.  Note that the file is not used
here directly; we incorporate Quick DER, which creates C header files from it
and supplies us with directly usable packers and unpackers, walkers and talkers.

THIS IS A COPY!!!
	The primary source has moved to Quick-DER, which installs the .h file.
