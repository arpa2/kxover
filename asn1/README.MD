This is the ASN.1 specification for KXOVER.  Note that the file is not used
here directly; we incorporate Quick DER, which creates C header files from it
and supplies us with directly usable packers and unpackers, walkers and talkers.
(TODO: Or do we use the extensive ASN.1 support available in Erlang?)

THIS IS A COPY!!!
	The primary source has moved to Quick-DER, which installs the .h file.
	The reasoning being, this is just *one* program implementing KXOVER.

THE PRIMARY SOURCE IS:
	https://github.com/vanrein/quick-der/blob/master/arpa2/kxover.asn1

	TODO: Keep the primary source up to date with work done here :-S
